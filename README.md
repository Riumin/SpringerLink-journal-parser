# SpringerLink journal parser
A parser designed to get a full archives of a certain academic journal published by SpringerLink

## This project need a further development!

I have upload the very initial python script to this repo and you could make use of it directly with an established env. I'll spare some other time to compile it to an execute. I'll hurry :D

To directly execute the python script you will need the following env:

- python3
- bs4 | Beautifulsoup the python module
- requests

Attention that `requests` the python module has not been built-in so far and you may have problems importing it. If so, a solution with [Google](http://google.com) may help :)

## Warning

I wrote this scripts as an extension of the existing [Sci-Hub](http://sci-hub.tw) project, which unlock most of the copyright journals. It could a great violence in the name of academic freedom. Please pay attention.
